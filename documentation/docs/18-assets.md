title: Asset handling

### Importing

[Vite will automatically process imported assets](https://vitejs.dev/guide/assets.html) for improved performance. Hashes will be added to the filenames so that they can be cached and assets smaller than `assetsInlineLimit` will be inlined.

```html
<script>
	import logo from '$lib/assets/logo.png';
</script>

<img alt="The project logo" src={logo} />
```

If you prefer to reference assets directly in the markup, you can use a preprocessor such as [svelte-preprocess-import-assets](https://github.com/bluwy/svelte-preprocess-import-assets) or [svelte-image](https://github.com/matyunya/svelte-image).

For assets included via the CSS `url()` function, you may find the [`experimental.useVitePreprocess`](https://github.com/sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte/blob/main/docs/config.md#usevitepreprocess) option useful:

```js
// svelte.config.js
export default {
	experimental: {
		useVitePreprocess: true
	}
};
```

### Optimization

You may wish to utilize compressed image formats such as `.webp` or `.avif` or responsive images that serve a different size based on your device's screen. For images that are included statically in your project you may use a preprocessor like [svimg](https://github.com/xiphux/svimg) or a Vite plugin such as [vite-imagetools](https://github.com/JonasKruckenberg/imagetools).
